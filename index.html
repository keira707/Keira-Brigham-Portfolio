<h1>*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ ABOUT ME  *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ</h1>

    
 <p> 
    I am Keira Brigham, a first-year computer science student enrolled at the University of South Wales. Alongside my academic pursuits, I am presently employed part-time at Dunelm. In the future, I intend to complete my master's degree simultaneously with pursuing a software development/management-related profession after earning my bachelor's degree.

<h1> *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ SKILLS *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ</h1>
    
  <p> 
    I have a unique combination of interpersonal and technical talents as a retail employee with two years of hands-on experience and a first-year computer science student. I excelled in customer service, problem-solving, multitasking, and calmness in fast-paced circumstances. Skills learnt from my ongoing degree are programming languages including C++ and HTML and cyber security in my first year of computer science. My adaptability, enthusiasm for learning, and love of computers make me a hard-working and driven individual.

<h1> *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ QUALIFICATIONS *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ</h1>

  <p>
    My academic background includes 12 GCSEs, including an A in Computer Science and Engineering. My three A-levels in Media Studies, Criminology, and Welsh Baccalaureate demonstrate my various talents and expertise. This educational foundation shows my dedication to excellence and my versatility across fields.
  </p>

<h1> *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟHOBBIES *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ</h1>

  <p>
    I practice programming aside from my 
      independent projects and coding challenges in university.
      I also play strategic and collaborative games with friends, 
      which improves cooperation, strategic thinking, and communication for business. 
      Ice skating showcases my commitment to a balanced lifestyle and reinforces discipline and persistence.
